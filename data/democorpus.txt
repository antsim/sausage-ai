Sanity holding by a thread Desperation draws them close to me Always unseen but never far behind Fleeting darkness tricks your eyes Paranoia, a creeping horror Guided by the death walking terror Your hand reaches for the knife Subconscious molding insidious It was always in your mind Release the pain, a psychotic rush Death walking terror Slow mental torture I am the blood you seek to spill I am your inner drive to kill Dark inspiration, a moral failure Created by the death walking terror Your hands have done my bidding well Your hideous dreams now reality Manipulation done with stealth I was with you, I heard the screams Death walking terror Slow mental torture Death walking terror Psychic tormentor The weakest ones will fall My murderous influence appeals to their fear My will is just too strong The decision was mine but they'll never know Death walking terror I walk behind you while you kill Usurping your mind, you are oblivious You'll never know your spirit fell Supplanted by this deep disgust Death walking terror, slow mental torture Death walking terror, psychic tormentor Moving through the cover of night With battle hardened hate in their eyes Anticipate the surgical strike Will suffer, panic stricken, traumatizing agony Violence, the purest form, a primitive trait The weak will inherit the Earth piled on top of their graves Survival is slipping the attack has already begun Dominant force batter their prey, bludgeons their weapon of choice A vicious tradition since the dawn of man Traumatizing agony Murderous revelry, smashing people to pieces This kind of hate cannot be contained Those who have fallen onto the ground will never rise again Squalid and broken no match for the enemy Too weak to fight back no chance for escape Covered in their own blood The surgical strike must go on Ripping out organs they're hung on display A message to others they'll die the same way Covered in their own blood The surgical strike must go on Squalid and broken no match for the enemy Too weak to fight back no chance for escape Covered in their own blood The surgical strike must go on Ripping out organs they're hung on display A message to others they'll die the same way Covered in their own blood The surgical strike must go on Moving through the cover of night With battle hardened hate in their eyes Anticipate the surgical strike Will suffer, panic stricken, traumatizing agony Patience is my ally Design should not be rushed Aspersions long forgotten Never left my mind My rage must be controlled My plans require time My rage must be controlled until the time is right Master of self control Seething deep inside Enemies oblivious My ruse has made them blind My rage must be controlled My plans require time My rage must be controlled until the time is right My hate has been concealed my time has come at last My hate has been concealed but now the scum will die Batter the face Crushing the pompous fool Retaliation This was worth the wait Endurance Deception Abhorrence Vengeance Wounds of the enemy Oozing hypocrisy Duplicitous slime They are less than nothing Twisted Slaves to their vanity They are beneath my feet Only now can they learn As my boot kicks their heads Pitiless tormenting Resolve never wavering Contemptible pieces of human trash litter my life Victory was certain They never saw it coming Years of planning have paid off Voices inside silenced Heads removed of their faces lay by my feet Chopped and hacked their bodies detached Eyes and teeth are violently smashed Gruesome acts I'm having strong urges to extract the brains Overwhelmed with demented thoughts Could it be that I committed these Gruesome acts Death is all I ever know Gore is what I need to help satisfy me Brains are all I ever crave Can't deny my hatred for society Blood so sweet upon my lips Live a life of moribund abnormalcy Born with only half a head Can't deny my hatred for intelligence The brain removal device Drained again through the mouth the blackest blood flows Save it for another day Savor the vile abundance of Gruesome acts Dead is like being alive Stench of rotting death becomes irrelevant Heads affixed to a machine Peel the skin from random skulls exposing bone Cracked open with vice like force Spray my face with human slop, carnal spatter Slave to my repulsive goal To regain control beyond what's in my mind The brain removal device Shredded brain tissue is mine Succulent flavor is pure Evil is personified Dominance Brutal conclusion foreseen Envisioned so long ago The slaughtered were unaware Contraption for hollowing heads Is forcing me to realize Cerebral obsession within is my reality Death is all I ever know Gore is what I need to help satisfy me Brains are all I ever crave Can't deny my hatred for society Blood so sweet upon my lips Live a life of moribund abnormalcy Slave to my repulsive goal To regain control beyond what's in my mind The brain removal device Rage, taking control of my mind Driving me to Kill without mercy I see red Blood on My hands My knife Crazed, boiling blood pumps through my heart Pushing me to Respond with violence I spill their Blood with Vicious Cruelty Maniacal Psychopath Slash through the crowd of faces leaving a trail of bloody dead Hold down the scumbag, slice off his ear, gouge out his fucking eyes Pounding the human maggots, broken bones cause screams of pain Femur pokes through the muscles in his upper leg, I wrench it out with force Stabbing the faces Knocking out teeth with my nail spiked bat Internal damage Trauma from beatings causes organs to burst Maniacal Psychopath Chunks of butchered victims cover the floor in my wake Frenzied battery and slashing slung pieces of face on the ceilings and walls Raging violence will consume all of my damaged brain Ruthless murders are the only way to make this impulse abate Maniacal Psychopath Dangling above a vat of putrid muck A rancid stench of foul decay never encountered before Screaming in horror for I now remember my fate I will be submerged in boiling flesh This cauldron will soon take my life Upside down my mind is warping Cannot break free From the shackles Bloodied chains cut circulation Losing reason Gag and vomit Blisters are forming all over my body now Oozing with pus as they start to explode, fervent finality The fumes and the vapors have perforated my lungs Writhing and twitching from maddening pain Why must I die like this? Insanity not far away Mental breakdown Scathing havoc Pray for death to come and get me Inner anguish Begins Fear Received Relentless Malignancy Near the end is what I'm sensing Must accept it Can't accept it Last attempt to stop this nightmare Cannot be done I will be dead Gone Berserk While waiting My life will boil To struggle is useless Plunge Fatal Paradise Of the obscene Enter the tank It doesn't take long Epidermis dissolved All that's let are my bones It's a matter of seconds when defleshed in flesh My body now part of sick mire This chamber of liquefied humans that I have amassed is completed because I was The last in line
